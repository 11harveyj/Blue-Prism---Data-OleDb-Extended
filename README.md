# Data - OleDb Extended
This is a clone of the Data - OleDb object included with Blue Prism as standard, with some extra functions to support parameters.

Usage:

Same as the existing, however with the parameters input collection, you only need 2 columns.

Column 1: Parameter ID

Column 2: Parameter Value
